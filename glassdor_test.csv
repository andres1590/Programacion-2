If you're lucky enough to get a parking spot in town (waiting list) - this is the most valuable benefit on offer (no really - financially the parking space is worth more than the pension). Easy life if you live locally.,"Pay in the Tunbridge Wells office matches the pay in the Manchester office so is CONSIDERABLY below market. I TRIPLED my salary within a year of leaving. Progression is limited and there is rampant favouritism and cronyism. No Salary bands are provided either so there is severe opaqueness in pay structure, which inevitably leads to huge turnover (over 30% in 2014, I believe) when people do learn of colleague's salaries.

The benefits, particularly the pension (3% matched - which by the way will be mandatory for all firms in 2018), are so terrible such that tea-making facilities are listed as a benefit on the employment contract. Ironic how bad the pension is, given that pensions form a large part of business. Other benefits: Death in Service (but only 3x). Town centre car parking, but there is waiting list of around a year. That's it.

They do offer to pay for training for the most basic qualification (the IOC), but very inflexible for additional training. They refused to allow me take time off for to do the study course for highly recognised CISI Diploma even though, because they refused to pay for it, I had forked out £1500 for it. They insisted time off for study come out of holiday!

Massive dislocation between the Tunbridge Wells (TW) and Manchester (HQ) offices. TW office ignored by the head honchos in Manchester as a satellite office, but still didn't have any autonomy (there was no single individual in charge of the 120+ staff at the TW office). Very disjointed management structures. HR were very disinterested and Senior Management are worse. When there were three consecutive years of poor results on the annual Times Best Companies survey - management told the junior staff and team leaders to identify the specific issues causing the disgruntlement, work out some solutions and report their findings to management (to implement, if they felt like it). Senior  Management didn't get involved until all the work had aleady been done!

There were also a lot of recurring problems,e.g. Data Protection Breaches that were being reported to the Board on a monthly basis, but the Board rarely, if ever, did anything about them. There was no top-down reinforcement of culture as the Board had no interest in the day-to-day running of what is still quite a small business, nor the staff."

The staff I work with are great, including the managers, though obviously this could vary tremendously between stores and regions.
I'm never really bored at work. Angry, tired, happy... Sure, but never bored.","The rota can be an nightmare. Your shifts can vary so wildly from week to week that your sleep and social life will most definitely suffer. If you're a particularly social person and enjoy regular weekends out and being with friends you should forget about the job right now because I haven't had a weekend off in months. One morning you're up at 3am, the next you're not on until 2pm and so on... Basically it's very hard to have any kind of regularity in your free time because the rotas are so varied and inconsistent. 

There's also a lot of variation in the way staff are treated. The gents are expected to do more heavy lifting, more physical work and that's fine, sure, but they're also typically the last people to get the time off that they want. In my store it's all too easy for a girl to bat her eyelids and get whatever time off she likes. Likewise certain members of staff seem to get away with murder. They perpetually under perform (making more work for the rest) without any repercussions. 

There really isn't that much room for advancement. At best, after many years of thankless grafting you can make your way to store manager. The money at that level is good, yes, but in return you basically have to live in the store. If you've any ambition to make it into upper management you need to reconsider because there is no opportunity for store employees to advance to that level. They would rather employ people straight out of university.

My last little gripe is the uniform. The clothes are fine and good but men have to be clean shaven. This might not bother you at all but to me seems antiquated and discriminatory at best. There's no hygiene basis for it whatsoever. You are allowed facial hair for religious reasons though, which is almost more insulting. Beards are okay, basically, as long as you're the right race and skin colour."
ALDI,2014-11-26, Store Assistant,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Teesside County Borough, England, England",1,1.0,1.0,,1.0,3.0,1.0,x,x,x,Bad Place to Work (Aldi UK),Higher level of pay than most other retailers (but you definitely earn it!),"I work as a store assistant in an Aldi store in northeast England. I have worked for other retailers and Aldi are by far the worst.
When I started with the company I was working 40 hours per week, just what I wanted, but in the last few months my hours have been cut to around 24 hours per week, meaning that my outgoings are more than my take home pay. This is mainly due to a recent mass recruitment campaign where many stores have doubled their staff numbers, but hired too quickly and taken on many poor and incompetent staff.
The management do not care about staff, if you question any policy you are shot down and have your card marked as a complainer, meaning that you get your hours cut further and have even less chance of promotion.
The stores are really run by area managers who are usually 21 year olds fresh out of uni, who have no idea about retail and have never had a job. They have no personnel skills and no idea on how to treat or speak to staff.
Aldi will cut staff hours right back, but still expect you to be 100% flexible and will rota you to be off and then call you into work at the last minute. They will guilt trip you and you'll go to the bottom of the overtime list if you can't or won't come in to work.
The final straw came this week when staff were told that they would not be allowed to park in the shop car park over the 2 week xmas period, meaning staff now have to find a parking space elsewhere in a very run down area and will have to walk long distances to the shop. Aldi really couldn't care less about their people."
ALDI,2015-02-10, Store Assistant,Current Employee,"Northampton, England, England",1,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,x,r,o,Awful from the first day,It's not bad pay however that is the only benefit of working for the company.,"Where to begin?

On my first week of working as an Aldi Store assistant, I was treated so horribly. I was shouted at in front of customers as I made small mistakes due to members of staff near breathing down your neck as you try to get used to the tills. As I was young and quite shy, at first, they tried to push me further. Other employees didn't make me feel welcomed, the manager didn't even speak to me. It felt like higher up had forced the store to employ new people but the store and everyone in it was dead against new faces.
I remember on one of my first shifts, I walked home crying my eyes out because I couldn't believe I'd traded in my old job for somewhere so horrific.
The employees they told to train me, openly told me they didn't want to do training and were aggressive. It was like they wanted to scare me into quitting. They gave us a list of hundreds of PLUs and told us we had to learn a certain amount per night, I felt like I was being taught by Miss Trunchable from Matilda, no exaggeration.

Then there are the managers. In Aldi, there are LOADS of managers to every store and 99% of them are unprofessional, perverse and just in capable of managing. One particular manager would come in, his shirt unwashed, marks of food and rubbish down him, smelling. It was disgusting.
One manager would refer to me as ""sexy lady""... MANAGER. Once he even grabbed my shirt, pulled me into his face. I just didn't know what to do.
Another manager was forever angry, you'd think that being spoken to in a polite manner was a privilege reserved for birthdays. She would shout, scream, give you dirty looks and just on a whole, make you feel uncomfortable. Again, her hair was filled with grease and she was unpresentable, despite us new employees being warned that lack of presentation is an offence at Aldi. 

The store system on a whole is kind of like a hierarchy. You have the employees that are the same level as you but are clearly far more 'valued' than yourself. Without promotion, they were given manager keys, which is a sackable offence had they been caught by anyone higher up and would often throw it in your face. I had a number of these, 'elite team members' we'll call them, say to me ""We might be the same level, but I'm still higher"". 

They also make you feel guilty for being ill. During my time there, I got the chickenpox. God, you'd think I ordered them, they were so rude to me on the phone. 

In the end, I was signed off of work from my doctor who advised me to look for another job as I had to be put on medication for anxiety due to Aldi. 

I provided sick notes covering my absence but, low and behold, they didn't even pay me statutory sick pay in the end, which again is illegal.

I handed in my notice on the 10th of January and when that letter came through the post to say I officially didn't work for Aldi anymore, I literally could not have been any happier!! 

Honestly, unless all you care about is money and are happy to be treated like mess on the bottom of your shoe, I would highly recommend you work anywhere else but Aldi. 

You have to ask yourself, why do they need to take in so many staff if it's such a great place to work? Why are they constantly hiring? Why is everyone leaving? 

i thought it was just the store I got put in but reading this reviews it just seems across the board it's just in general an awful place to work."

I recieved disciplinary for arriving 15 mins early and getting onto shop floor 10 mins before my start time. Deputy managers are just kids with no training/ management experience hence they act the big man because of their job title. Was told to speed up on my second day, even though i didnt know where the products go yet. my speed got faster but then recieved a disciplinary on my 2nd week for not being as fast as people who worked there for 9 months. Was told to come in at 8.30 am for an induction, but was actually there to be sacked for the disciplinary thing before i had even worked another shift after the diciplinary, so had no chance to even try to improve. Also worked 9 hours wihtout a break and yet 8 hours in i was asked ""why are you slowing down"". Actually felt relieved when i was sacked. Overall a terrible job."

Paid Break.

Shop floor staff friendly.","Where to begin? 
Their expectations of employees regarding palette times is incredibly optimistic. Just watch the undercover show on channel 4 regarding Aldi, its absolutely true. This is mainly due to the fact it doesn't consider customers asking for advice nor a small warehouse in my case. Unlike other supermarkets you also have to do the picklist which isnt in alphabetical order, its all random.

This ultimately will be what causes you stress, Aldi's targets, if you're on tills it's about items scanned.

Some days I go into the warehouse and see the stock and just know I'm getting a ""written conversation"" this company doesn't care about your circumstances nor you. 

Aldi absolutely uses intimidation in order to push their employees to work faster, for example, if you weren't fast enough expect a disciplinary. They will keep warning you ways of getting a disciplinary to scare you into working more efficiently. They use fear because they know most their staff won't be able to find another job easily and they can replace you quickly.

Aldi also believes that 4am is sociable hours. If you're doing a night shift then only 4 of your hours will be night pay. 

It is very likely that you will have to work an entire part of the supermarket on your own. 

Don't expect a career here.

I understand if you're job hunting this seems like a good choice but believe me just move on. I already made that mistake."
ALDI,2016-03-18, Store Assistant,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Manchester, England, England",1,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,x,o,r,Store Assistant,"To be bluntly honest the only pro, for a Store Assistant, is the friends you make with the other Store Assistants, Because you're all in it together. I met my best friend at Aldi, so for that I'm truly grateful.","Yeah the salary seems fabulous but if you track your hours correctly you'll find you're not being paid right. Basically the Um and Ah for the complaint period (7 days) so you never get it rectified. 
The benefits package??? Don't make me laugh. It's totally useless. Even if it was useful, you'd not get the chance to use it as your entire life is Aldi. The shift patterns are extremely undesirable. When doing the rotas they seem not to consider whether or not you need to sleep and eat. 
Wake up feeling ill??? Don't even think of ringing in as not even death is an excuse as to why you can't make it in to your shift. If you're lucky not to get screamed at for ringing in and you get say three days off sick, don't imagine it'll mean you've had three days off sick. They use the Bradford Factor and you end up with a crazy score at the end. I had four days off (not in a row) and I scored 16!!! It's a system to stop people taking the you know what. Which, of course, is not fair to people who are genuine. If you look the Bradford Factor up you'll see that it is described as short-sighted and unsuccessful. I'm not surprised Aldi chose that system.
I went to Aldi knowing it would be hard. The work is back breaking and there is no let up. It's like you're expected to be in many places at once while a negative atmosphere swirls around you. Instead of training me properly I have spent almost my entire time there being screamed at. Due to said atmosphere, the team structure constantly breaks apart and the jobs given are done half-assed. I mean who wants to work really hard at 6am with a manager stood over you constantly spewing negativity all over you? So I don't blame them but sorting their mistakes always seems to get me in trouble!!
Each manager has their own way of working the shop floor. Sometimes it leaves my head spinning as I just don't know how to do anything without upsetting at least two managers. You have to keep changing the way you do things. That being said, if you're a ""favourite"" you can pretty much do as you please. 
When I say ""favourite"" I am of course referring to the Store Managers ""Click"". If you're not in that click, woe betide you. The you know what will be flung in your direction.
Managers get in trouble for not being negative enough. I even have an idea that they are not allowed to be positive. Anyone that threatens the balance of this 1950s structure is out. Transferred without being asked. So do I want to be promoted? No. 
The money is just not worth it for any level. 
When it comes to your health, sometimes they can be sympathetic, that is until they realise it will mess with their productivity. Work place accident? About six months in I had a serious accident that involved me going to the hospital. On returning to the store I was told I might face disciplinary action. They really don't care about your well being.
Before anyone who reads this review and judges me as a disgruntled employee, I'd like to say I'm not. I am actively seeking employment elsewhere. I am resigned to my current fate. I just want people to know what it is actually like."

This allows the company to be incredibly efficient but if things go wrong, or management is not working effectively, ALDI can be a messy, frustrating and stressful place to work. As a result, personnel management is often overlooked and you are likely to find yourself frustrated by lack of training, mentoring or general feedback. Professional development will be mostly down to yourself, don't expect too much help. Also be prepared to put up with politics and preferential treatment. Of course, this mostly depends on the management in store but after 10 years and 6 different stores, these are common issues I have faced or heard about from colleagues."

So Aldi bully store managers and then it trickles down to store & stock assistants. I worked at AlDI for over 12 months after leaving the HM forces and believe today this day that I was treated unfair and disrepeacted and bullied. I got spat at my a duty manager and pushed into a mirror but nothing was done about it. It was my word against his so there was no trust and no loyality and integrity at AlDI. Yet they expect us to have all those things but when they dont okay by the rules they expect us too. I would highly reccomend that if you are looking to apply at AlDI prepare to go through alot of mental and physical challenges and never believe what the managers say they just like to squeeze every bit of energy from you and then let you quit and then Aldi can hire somone else. That's Aldi's game plan.

As such they can be incredibly demotivating, rude and disrespectful. Personally I was denied funeral leave by my area manager ( a contractual right) based on lack of staff, yet they claim to be all about their people. Occasionally show a good attitude towards work life balance but you’re expected to work a MINIMUM of 48 hours a week with no real upper limit. Some of my colleagues regularly work 60-70 hours a week and many experienced salaried managers have either left or been pushed out due to this. By and large the ones who never say no and sacrifice everything for the business get the promotions and the good will. Genuinely loved it when I started out but there is a culture of fear and punishment from area managers nowadays that does little to motivate its staff. All they care about is the business and their own progression, very sad to see."
