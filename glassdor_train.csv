The work they expect is ridiculous, after training I was told by the manager I am working too slow, I explained I had just finished training but that wasn't good enough.

The company has been on an amazing growth journey, certainly since then which it has been a privilidge to be a part of. The below is a list of the benefits to me personally, and is not exhaustive.

-Scope for career progression to those that demonstrate the hunger and the skills required. It must be noted that you need to be realistic with your ambitions and a career is a career and not an overnight process. AFH reward loyalty, and if you demonstate the right abilities and attributes for more senior positions, combined with becoming an experienced team member and obtaining any examinations (if required), you will find yourself climbing up the career progression scale and experience the benefits that come with that increased responsibility. 
-Full financial support for relevant examinations which are approved by your line manager. I have had many exams and material paid for over the years which has supported me a lot and has always been fully appreciated. 
-The staff. Amazing, friendly people throughout the business and many friends for life who I have met through working there both past and present workers. This makes a working day so much better when you have good people around you.
-Package aside from salary includes pension, a reasonable amount of healthcare (primarily dental and optical) and an annual bonus. There have been sweeteners in the past e.g. share options which for a growing company can be extremely lucrative. There is also a really attractive tiered loyalty bonus scheme which if in it for the long haul can be very welcoming. 
-Social aspect is really good. Christmas party, summer ball, summer BBQ, and annual charity football match to name a few.
-AFH sponsor a charity each year and there are many interesting events throughout the year which staff are invited to join in on from conquering Snowdon, running in Birmingham 10k, skydives, pub quiz or just good old bake offs.
-Compressed working pattern offered to certain workers (not all). A benefit I consume and it‚Äôs something that is not easy to put a price on. A working week compressed into 4 days allowing for the same rate of pay, but 3 days off in a working week instead of 2.

Once did a shop inventory and worked 6am-11pm then back in at 5am to finish at 5 that afternoon. A healthy 29 hours worked with 6 hours between shifts (2 of which driving!)

As other people elude to the other Area Managers are fine, except from the ones who have been there for a few years. One told me with pride how he had worked a 110hr week which gives you some idea of their mindset.

Once had to drive for 6 hours on my day off as a store manager had locked the key in the safe so backwards and forwards from the head office. Led to me falling asleep whilst driving (you need the days off to catch up!) and nearly crashing which ultimately made my decision to leave much easier."

Work scehdule is unbelievable, one week it's 6am starts and the next it's evening starts and this rotates weekly. Work life balance is destroyed, it's bad enough the place is under staff, you're expected to do the work of two. You're having to come into work sleep deprieved aswell, this takes it's toll. Expect wrinkles fast if that's not off putting then also a lower life expectency. 

Management is full of bitter aggressers, bit like the guards in Shawshank. Feel as if the title gives them license to do and say whatever to those without. And that there are superior to those below them and it's stems from the top. But this is odd as it's a job that requires little to no education to enter, hard to understand where the superiority comes from even Area managers simply need a undergrade degree of any discipline to enter. Perhaps it's the lack of knowledge that creates this higher status mentality within management steming from the top. 

Area managers are younglings straight out of Uni with no life experience, this is again to get the most out of them working 60-100 hours weekly, as they don't know any better and have no other commitments at that age. Bit like the stock trading sector in London however the ones Aldi employ tend to be entitled narcissists with type A personalities, that only require a degree in any profession to enter the position and it's as they tend blame their ""training"" for any and all errors and mistreatment of stuff and their own personalities. So they tend to struggle to relate to staff members of any age and also behave in sicklical ways. Much like children, they will engage in wars with individuals whether it be store assistants or managers. This stems from the belief that I have this title so you must see as this way and act this way, my behaviour may resemble that of a 12 year old and I may seem 300 miles away from what an area manager should be but  you must act as if I am warden and address me as such.

The worst of it is nothing can be disputed, their word is law these kids are not watched but left alone with thier magnifying glass. It's deeply demoralizing for the people working around them, recieving constant feedback on trivial matters, passive aggressive tactics and no oppurtunity to explain yourself as anything like that is viewed as back chat and the penality is cold shoulders and a loss in the oppertunity to progress in the company. To top it off there is no way to change this as these kids are the way makers and get away with acting like Jeff Bezos from his early days at Amazon and are more obtuse than the Warden out of Shawshank, the staff have no option but to take it on the chin like a man(because thats how men should be) and quickly lose their mental state for an extra pound over other retailers. There are no possible ways to speak to someone to solve this problem even the area managers themselves can't be reasoned with, you are classed as nothing  but low income earning trash by a Sports Science graduate recovering from his 21st. 

Look for something else unless you are don't want to deal with all that, not an isolated incident happening in many of these stores.  Have worked with company for 4 years been in 9 stores in 4 regions, it's same everywhere. But if you wanna feel anxious at work everyday maybe it's for you, I was gonna call this WORST RETAIL JOB OUT THERE but I think ""Real life Shawshank redemption"" is more fitting, creates a more fitting portrayal of Aldi life."

It is understandable that the company does not want to spend time training someone for a promotion if in the end they will take a desired job else where if offered.  From the employee point of view, there is no incentive to work hard because you are made to feel unappreciated and blatantly told that you will have no future with the company unless you fully commit to it as a career.  Some employees have kept their aspirations and target dreams job a secret, in the hopes of being promoted (for the wage increase) so that they can sooner save up and leave Aldi. 

There is a culture of bullying among all levels within the store and this is common nation wide.  Troubled managers are simply transferred to other stores rather than being dismissed from the role or demoted.  These troubled managers face no threat of punishment for their behaviour, thus they continue treating staff badly because they know that they will get away with it.  

Food storage standards are pretty low within some branches.  Some stores have small warehouses but receive large deliveries of chilled and frozen products.  What can't be stored in fridges and freezers is left to float around the warehouse for up to 12 hours, reaching room temperatures or actually becoming warm if left near air conditioning units.  These pallets of chilled products do finally make it to the appropriate storage, but not before reaching dramatic changes in temperature.  

The recent Channel 4's Dispatches episode was only presenting the tip of the ice berg when it came to staff moral and low levels of health and safety.  One example of unnecessary pressure is that til staff must scan over 1000 items per hour or face a disciplinary.  If a customer is physically slow, elderly or disabled, no exceptions are to be given, you still must scan as fast as possible and it is up to the customer to keep up with your pace!    
Staff who stack the shelves have strict times to keep to when working each pallet.  There is no time to fetch a ladder or carry it around the store.  You are encouraged to climb shelving, while balancing heavy boxes in one hand.  Whatever the customer doesn't see, doesn't happen in other words.  
 
Aldi employ a lot managers who have left other supermarkets, after talking to them it would appear the cons listed above are common across the board."

I was looking for a change in career and after a lot of research, thought and analysing I decided to apply for Aldi as they appear to be a great company to work for. I applied for assistant store manager and was surprised at how lengthy the whole process was - I saw that as a positive, thinking the company invest a lot into their staff. Nope, that was completely wrong. 

I left my already good job to go onto Aldi (which I thought would be a great move for me). From day one I realised it was the biggest mistake of my life. Firstly the hours are a joke - as an assistant store manager you're expected to work a MINIMUM if 48 hours and then everything else on top. Aldi will tell you over and over again at interview, in their books, in their manuals that you get all this time back - IT IS COMPLETE RUBBISH, DO NOT BELIEVE IT. You also get a day off: if you class your day off as sandwiched between finishing at 11pm the night before and starting at 4am the day after. I came from a job where I worked 12 hour shifts and worked hard - I am NOT afraid of hard work, however Aldi is a complete joke. There is no way (unless you're Superman) you can get everything done. Oh and on your day off, you're expected to trek all the way to the store to hand over the safe key, which takes over 2 hours in total - which you're not paid for. This happens at all of the stores, so just bare that in mind if you actually have a life outside of work. 

Also the bullying culture is horrendous, you are told as a manager to micro manage all of the store assistants and watch them on CCTV constantly to try catch them out. The store manager left me on my own to close up the store after I'd been there for less than a week, then the next day decided to watch my every move on CCTV in fast forward and show me where he felt I went wrong. It was awful - constantly criticised for everything. Whatever you do it isn't good enough. The poor store assistants are given impossible tasks to do just so they fail, this is meant to be some kind of character building exercise but I fail to see how it builds anyone's character other into wanting them to leave. 

I left without a second glance - I'd rather sweep the streets in a snowstorm wearing nothing than work for Aldi. It was the worst experience of my life and even if you want to raise a complaint on how you're treated, they won't let you. Hence why they can say their staff are so happy - they literally will NOT let you complain about anyone senior. 

Area managers are a joke and are all straight out of uni, have no social skills and talk to other human beings like dirt. 

So, if like me, you were looking for a change of career - keep scrolling. Aldi will run you. Don't do it."

This helps to make the job easier and you can make some friends along the way.

Challenging, rewarding work - The workloads aren't for those who don't enjoy physically challenging work. However, if you achieve the often difficult targets, it is rewarding to do so, and you often find yourself going home knowing you've done a good days work.

Management - The management in store are down to earth and often understand you, and want you to progress. They set you long and short term targets, and often give and request feedback on how you are doing at work, which helps to set realistic long term goals.","Shifts - Shifts often change at the drop of a penny and you are expected to adjust to any changes made, even if you planned otherwise prior to this. 5am starts for days on end can also become tedious. however, once you finish, the rest of the day is yours!

Targets - Even though Aldi is known for its difficult pallet time targets, it is often shocking to see how quickly you are expected to get stock onto the shelves, even if you are understaffed on some days. If one member of staff is missing due to illness, you are expected to make up for their times, and still hit pallet times without the extra hands."

I appreciate shop talk at work is important, but on a 3 hour drive there should be at least a hint of other interests.

Honestly, 40k and an Audi sounds great, but you will end up forgoing some pretty valuable years of post graduation life. You've waited 3 or 4 years to finally get a salary and ditch the student digs. Don't waste it by shooting for a high salary and missing out on a life. You'll end up a pasty, overworked, underweight and frankly very boring individual.

P.S you friends will think you are boring if you take this job - it's a unavoidable side effect - selling cabbages is not interesting.

I now work in Tech, Make more money and have regular working hours that mean I can enjoy a work life balance. If you're passionate about retail and not much else then go for the AM grad scheme. If you have any other passion, creativity, outlet you need to be willing to sacrifice it. When I read similar reviews in 2014 I thought.. It can't be that bad. It's honestly not worth it."

If your staff are happy, feel well cared for, listened to and fairly remunerated for what they do then they will respect the company and want to deliver a service to the best of their ability. If you don‚Äôt do these things, which unfortunately is the case at AFH, the reverse is true. They focus too much on ‚Äòcheap labour‚Äô and harbour an atmosphere of ‚Äòus and them‚Äô between senior management and staff. I genuinely believe the CEO wants to do right by the staff but he is surrounded by yes people who shelter him from what‚Äôs really happening on the office floor. They don‚Äôt look after their own, people who have been loyal to the company for many years, other than those who have made it to a seat at the board table. When it comes to promotions, they prefer to recruit externally rather than those with experience who have worked their way through the ranks which is often a cause of frustration for staff who keep being promised their next promotion is just around the corner. HR is a shambles and you wouldn‚Äôt want to tell them anything remotely confidential otherwise it‚Äôs round the office as gossip in no time at all. They certainly don‚Äôt want people who will challenge the order of things or suggest a new way of thinking. It is a shame as I think the company has a lot of potential but unfortunately, despite beating you over the head about being ‚Äòthe employer of choice‚Äô, right now they are anything but. The company is growing rapidly but unless they do something soon about the multitude of unhappy staff (I interacted with all the departments in the business and almost every single person felt the same way), the entire back office support system will collapse and they won‚Äôt have any long term, knowledgeable or experienced staff to hold the business up."

The benefits on top of your salary could be a desired addition to your employment, however, most people do not use said benefits so they are effectively nul and void.","The environment is extrememely biased in that if you are one of the chosen ones then your time there can be rewarding and enjoyable, however, if you are professional, accomplished and have experience from working in other estsblishments then you are seen as 'not the AFH way'.
The senior managment leave a lot to be desired. Most people there will hinder your career as opposed to progress it as it is a vindictive and malicious environment. The salary accross the board is undesirable in that 2 people could be doing the same role and the favoured party will be paid considerably more as they are a 'yes person' and most likely affraid to challenge for positive and productive outcomes.

The investment ethos also leaves a lot to be desired and many other investment companies in the midlands have better returns in comparison and therefore are better businesses in practice.

If you want to give your life up then you can earn a lot by progressing to assistant manager or store manager.","Worked here for 5 years. They pay you a good hourly rate, however this is controlled by the amount of hours they let you work. When prod is tight they will cut your hours from 40 to 25 which is a massive drop in pay. Yet they will give you all the hours as and only when the managers want. Days can start at 4am or finish at midnight, flexibility is a massive thing. They change your rota at the last minute. 
It's very clicky, staff who are liked by management ""friends"" will get the better hours, shifts and jobs. If your not liked as much as the next person, you'll just get stuck on a till for 10 hours with only 2 fifteen min breaks. The old staff tend to push new staff aside and are hardly given a chance to prove themselves. You're constantly being ""performance"" monitored via cctv and test trollies. Deputy Management tend to be young people with very limited experience, they got promoted as they were liked by the store manager, regardless as to weather they are up for to job. They also have big power kicks and look down on store assistants. They will pass jobs on to you simply because they can't be arsed, regardless of what other jobs you're doing, they have the time to do the job but they'd prefer not to.
There is no communication between management. The clicky groups gang up on certain member of staff, a lot of nasty things get said behind staffs back.

2. ""You can't go home 'til it's finished"". If it takes an extra 6 hours after a 10 hour night shift, tough luck. 

3. ""Your thanks is your paycheck"" never expect a thankyou or well done. That's what is expected of you, because Aldi pays you the extra pound an hour. Anything less is unacceptable.

""I just go home and drink"" I lost count of how many members of the management team give this exact answer when speaking about how they cope with the pressure."

Some directors only have frequent contact with certain team members due to certain projects which means they don't spend enough time with the rest of you to understand more about the type of person you are.
- In Aldi's IT, industry standard practices, whether it be Agile project teams or concepts of the way a developer operates in a standard setup, are not followed and it feels disjointed.
- Career progression between the standard level most are employed at and management level is very difficult as the intermediate stages are viewed as project manager/senior business analyst type roles and are not suited to more technical roles.
- Pay starts below industry average for most experience levels for a standard role, therefore may be better suited to those with little experience or performing a career change.
- Considering the size of the company, they should be able to afford more role-specific training.
- If your beard is your pride and joy, don't come here or failing that find God (all men must shave, except for religious reasons).

To be put forward for this course is by the heads of departments. It's a very unfair way of doing it as what a head of department sees Vs managers or team leaders is very different. Again it's a face fits issue.  

lack of support. There is very little support whether it be with mental health (there are mental health first aiders but this isn't widely used nor promoted), issues with team members (allowing members of the team to be negative and disruptive without any ramifications. Most of the time they think it's easier to just ignore the issue) or external qualifications (the apprenticeships are meant to be on the job however there is very little time allocated to help them pass) . If you have issues, they are just swept under the rug. 

bonuses and pay. Essentially you get what your manager thinks you are worth. If they don't like you (again your face doesn't fit) they will penalise you using your bonus and pay. You could have worked your behind off all year and you wouldn't get anything whilst the disruptive person will get a lovely bonus and pay rise because the manager can't deal with the ear ache. The bonuses aren‚Äôt assessed fairly and they vary department by department. 

poor pension contributions. Considering that AJ Bell are a pension company and have won multiple industry awards, the pension contribution is shocking. 

Some members of HR and learning a development are very supportive but their hands do become tied. 

All in all its not a horrendous place to work and I have worked in worst places."

If you do as asked and contribute to team Aldi has a lot to offer. It's very team work orientated and if you help out your co-workers and vise versa everything works as it should. Weak links are quickly pointed out though they do compensate for new starters by having an extra team member on for a week or so cut pick up the slack.

The pay is ok, but you do work hard for it. Shifts are usually 6,8 and 10 hours starting from 6am on an early shift or until 9pm on a late. 

Days consist of working working deliveries (main, bread, chiller, freezer and produce) produce can be hard work at 6am let me tell you! Working on till which is like nothing else. You scan as quick as you can for hours on end whilst remember fruit, veg and various other product numbers. It's easier than it sounds as you pick up the numbers quickly on the job. Then there's carding which is basically tipping out what left in boxes and rearranging the shelves and putting the card in the compactor. Then there cleaning up on the late shift.

Providing you show your worth on the shop floor you will find your self on the tills less.


Contract was 20hrs minimum but I usually averaged 30-35 per week. You got one Saturday, one Sunday, one whole weekend, and worked one whole weekend per month plus days off in the week. No complaints.","The main point here is that you work HARD for your money. If you're lazy, like the odd skive, fancy a quick smoke...Forgot it, you will not last a week. 

It's physically demanding, expect to lift heavy loads throughout the day. If you're ok with this you'll be fine.

Sometimes finishing on time proves tricky. I'm unsure why this is but it annoyed me on a few occasions.

This combined with the ridiculously high turn over of staff means no-one ever knows what they're doing, mistakes are constantly made and the workload piles up for the few experienced staff members to have to deal with.
- AJ Bell ensure that you can only progress if you are having marital relations with one of the managers, or if they want to have marital relations with you. Hard work is not recognised or appreciated.
- It seems that bullying is widely accepted throughout the company as the HR team have absolutely no power or purpose. If an anonymous complaint is made about a particular manager then it will always get back to them & make the situation worse. There are no consequences to their actions until the bullied staff member decides they have no option but to leave.
- The directors only care about lining their pockets and company image to protect their share prices - there is such a huge push every year to ensure the company survey helps them reach the Times top 100 company list, and if staff members leave bad reviews then their Team Leaders are punished by having their annual bonus taken away.
- Despite the compulsory staff attended biannual meetings the Director holds to boast of the sheer increase of growth and profits, pay rises were denied in 2020 for the majority of staff (aside from upper management)."

Aldi is a discounter wih increadible prices for the quality but achieves this in a number of ways, not least by keeping staffing levels very low and driving productivity rates to levels not seen elsewhere. 

This all sounds fine, but in reality it makes for a tough working environment where your hours make up for the lack of colleagues - a convenient cost saving for the company, which employes well motivated individuals to achieve this.  At store level breaks are often not taken, or simply cannot be taken if the store is too busy because there is simply no back up. Some stores may be staffed by only two people and both may be required on the cash tills if the store is busy, to the detriment of all other tasks that need to be undertaken in the store. This is fun and a buzz to begin with but the fun palls as the reality of your working life sinks in!  The turnover of staff is prodigious - both self selecting and by the axe for those who can't keep the pace.

At Area or District Manager level, keen, ambitious, motivated people are selected to join the training programme with a healthy carrot of promotion opportunities and sector beating pay.  If you are attracted by this do a bit of due diligence before accepting!  The sector beating pay comes in annual increments - it doesn't start off fantastically.  This gives Aldi a chance to vet you in role first.  Fair enough?  Area Managers in training are used to run stores in preparation for their promotion to fully trained area manager - this gives Aldi a fantastic resource of ambitious thrusters to be used to run difficult and often failing stores for less than the price of a fully trained store manager.  An additional company benefit is that AM's in training voluntarily work any hours required (store managers often do not - mindful of employment laws!) to run their stores and will travel to wherever the company requires them to work without complaint unlike store managers.  The loyalty is one way however - a large number of area managers in training are needed at any stage to fill roles in stores and because few will make the grade.  A few from any intake will make full Area Manager and a few from this group will be promoted to Director in time.  However the rest will usually 'leave' after a few years providing advancement opportunities for the next group of ambitious hard working talent.

In my 3 years I saw in excess of 30 people come and go to service 10 area manager positions.  The clue is in how frequently Aldi advertises in the recruitment pages for these roles!"

- Great people to work with (dependent on the store you work at)
- Paid break (but there is a downside to that too!)
- Company benefits such as discounts on some places.","Where do I begin:

- The time to unload pallets of new stock is incredibly unrealistic and you are often stopped by customers to help them with their enquiries. 

- If you're working a delivery shift, the delivery is sometimes late meaning you won't get out on time and have to find other work to occupy yourself. Even if you still don't get the delivery finished on time despite it not being your fault that it's late, expect a written conversation.

- Maximum of 30 minutes break, even if you are working a 10 hour shift which is not enough in my opinion when working in a fast paced environment like Aldi, where one easily become burned out. 

- Some shifts you are stuck on till all day, even up to 10 hours. 

- Shoplifting; the store that I work at has had an increase in shoplifting. There are no security guards employed to protect staff and customers from people who will harm you if you dare to get in their way. 

- Be expected to work like a robot!  

- The work life balance is terrible and barely given any thought; my social life has suffered because a lot of my time is taken up by working! 

- High staff turnover. 

- Never enough staff around to get the job done; if the store is really busy, most of the staff in store will be busy working away on tills. Which means you sometimes might end up collecting all of the empty cardboard boxes off the shelves after the store is closed, so in other words don't expect to finish your shift on time!

- Sometimes asked to come into work on days off at the drop of a hat.

- Rotas are changed often, meaning that you have to abandon all the plans you have made on your free time to come in to work. 

- Don't expect to get given a party at Christmas.

- No staff discount."

I had a great team around me and excellent mentors. I found the team leader (Martin) and manager (Lauren) to be full of knowledge and always there to push me to strive for better. The team itself was really approachable and everyone was happy to help where they could.

I had quite a lot of interaction with other departments and it was really nice to see that there was a big family vibe across the business.

The low bar for staff entry means you can get your first experience in Financial Services before moving on to a company that actually protects and values its staff. My advice to anyone looking to work at AJ Bell is to use it as a stepping stone in your career. Get the experience, and the name on your CV, then get out.","First the minor points:
- Poor salary, consistently under industry averages for virtually every position in the business.
- Poor benefits, awful pension contributions for a company founded on pension business
- The company regularly promise improvements which never arrive, particularly the pay levelling of staff which ended up falling short.
- Very poor access to industry training, unless it makes the company compliant. Almost constant need for internal courses, though.

The major failings:
- HR department which is not fit for purpose, with ill-defined processes leading them to make things up as they go.
- Any time off you take is weighed up using the Bradford Factor and used against you, so there‚Äôs almost a fear of being ill.
- Sexist language is heard frequently, as are inappropriately sexual jokes. But, it's to be expected given the example set when Heads of Department are sleeping with their direct reports.
- Aggressive behaviour and language are commonplace. But they‚Äôre seen as signs of ambition rather than yet another troubling sign of a toxic masculine culture.
- Even more troublesome is the many stories of sexual harassment which are common knowledge, none of which seem to result in action against those men involved."

Probably specific to my store but management are very cliquey and often don't confide in store assistants to do the job properly in a condescending way when in reality we are more than capable. 
Work hours are more or less either 6am-2pm or 2pm-10pm which is hard when you want to have a social life. Don't get me wrong it's suitable for students who are working around uni times.

Regularly throughout the year, the CEO and head of HR meet with a representative from each team in the Employee forum. They listen to ideas and ways to improve things from staff across the company. 
We have an intranet which keeps us updated on the goings on from across the business. The CEO also carries out presentations to inform us of how we are performing and again a chance to ask any questions we may have.

No work life/home balance. Minimum contracts, higher contracts always promised but nothing ever comes of it. Extra hours are not always available and inconsistent but still expected to work over 60 hours at Christmas. 
Pay has been so misconceived by outside sources. The pay is actually awful, they never pay you right. Always feels like they dock you and leave out hours of pay. You are too exhausted at this point to even care or figure it out though. If you leave, they don‚Äôt pay you at all so don‚Äôt work notice. Just leave on payday, go work at Tesco for 10p less and without a workload of 5 robots. 
No advancement opportunities, most managers are 15 to 20 years in, in their mid 40s or 50s and the area managers who boss them about are straight out of university 20 year olds. They are clueless and never last even a year. Don‚Äôt believe the lies, don‚Äôt waste your time. Do not ruin your life.

After being offered the job you realise quickly you‚Äôve been given a position in the  overworked scapegoat department. 

Pay variance- it‚Äôs massive between us some admins. Although it‚Äôs top secret, you are not suppose to discuss what you get paid. If you happen to be paid more that the threshold, you are burdened with that responsibility your whole career.  No pay rises, annual increases even if you‚Äôre promoted! It becomes your fault someone actually paid you a decent wage. 

You are just a number, easily replaced and not valued. 

Never go against the gain- you‚Äôll be as branded defector all your career. Feedback or pointing out areas of improvement goes against the totalitarian regime. 

Good people leave or randomly disappear- it happens a lot! 

Overworked- volumes are through the roof. None of the senior management have any concepts of the levels of work the teams are experiencing. It becomes very apparent when people leave and are replaced with two people (doing their position)  , how much they actually contributed. But to Senior Management you are just a number, easily replaceable, they don‚Äôt care! 

Goodwill is taken for granted .AJ Hell believe you should freely give this away and rely so heavily on this that people burn out very quickly. Though their goodwill is never shared.

MI- Senior management clown about in the boardroom, peakcocking about their made up MI stats in order to inflate their own ego! While the board clap their performance and the truth about their departments  is swept under the carpet.  

Overtime- you won‚Äôt get paid. This is where you are forcefully volunteering your services to help the rich people of AJ Hell get richer. Remember doing your bit for the corporate community service here! 

Don‚Äôt appreciate or recognise your service- one person apparently got a framed picture of them for working there 15 years. I‚Äôm sure a mirror would have been perfectly sufficient. Another said they got sandwiches made by a director for their 10 year anniversary and made to go on lunch with them. All thrilling experiences I hope. 

Best companies- very precious about this. Around a month before the release of the survey team leaders/ management turn into Gollum corrupted by a score for their area. Managers gave you a biscuit and let you sit at their desk when completing the survey. Like that‚Äôs what your aspirations in life are! 

Going for a promotion is a lot like being judged at Cruffs. They judge you on your appearance, how you parade round the office and how obedient you are to them.

IT systems are basically just pimped up fisher price computers. I once called IT as all the banks of desks would not log on. I was told to email a screenshot of this to service  desk! 

Volunteering and raising money - always volunteering activities but some ways of the raising money were a bit seedy. I was never a fan of sitting on Santa‚Äôs (directors) laps and paying him for the privilege of my bottom being in contact with his legs, then receiving a celebration chocolate as a reward for my endeavours.

Freebies- we use to get an Easter egg each year, after  becoming a PLC times were hard and a couple of creme eggs were scattered among the department, in a bird seed type fashion. 

HR - there is nothing human about them, nor do they have the resources to actually do anything. It‚Äôs basically do as I say not as I do."

The salaries at this company across the board are very low compared to their competitors. The bonus is also extremely low and you have to constantly justify to your manager why you are entitled to a bonus in end of year reviews.

Salary increases are not actual salary increases they are just in line with inflation. Salary and bonus are not determined by your level of effort at all. No overtime pay ever available. Effort is therefore not rewarded at all at AJ Bell, you shall receive the same pay for whatever effort you put in.

Management

Management have little to no knowledge of the financial services industry whatsoever. They are just told by upper management to manage by fear and constantly harass and bully staff to work longer hours which is due to constantly being understaffed. 

Management also alter MI so that it shows a team is performing well when it isn‚Äôt which is lying to upper management. 

Culture

Some areas better than others but overall there is a serious issue at AJ Hell from managers to make decisions from fear of getting blamed. This creates an awkward environment where teams aren‚Äôt run properly. This is done so that they can then blame their staff members to avoid any accountability and use them as scape goats if anything goes very wrong.

Promotions

Promotions are never given to people who deserve them. AJ Hell is very backwards in the way that you can only get promoted if a vacancy arises for that position and not down to merit. 

IT systems

The systems are a complete joke there are always issues. IT are nice and friendly but have very little knowledge to solve issues. IT issues can remain unresolved for months as they can just open and close ‚Äúcalls‚Äù so it appears as though your issues are resolved.

Overall:

Started doing 30 + hours per week with 3 people on the shift, now expected to do the same amount of work but in 18 - 20 hours per week, and with only 2 people on the shift instead of 3. No pay rise or incentive to do extra work expected.
I arrive at 10pm for the night shift, and will be told my finish time when I arrive, which will be anything from 4am - 8am.
Was told during induction that nightshifts are blocked together to help the nightshift have more regular sleep patterns. Hardly ever happens. Everytime a worker leaves theyll be hundreds of applicants willing to take their place, Aldi know this and exploit it to the max. They keep prices low by screwing over their work force. You must be clean shaven for every shift, no designer stubble at all. And you are told you cannot say anything negative about Aldi on the internet or social media, this a an instant sackable offence. Stock assistants are not entitled to sick pay because theyre classed as a business perk."

My sleeping pattern has completely messed up with the 6AM starts one day and not starting until 2PM the next and working on until 3AM the next morning. The management tend to look down on people who are new starts or younger employees such as myself, especially if you're in some form of education as they seem to think that I must think I'm better than them for studying at college and only working part-time. I have been made to stay on past my finishing time almost every shift that I'm on without being asked, and if I ask to leave most times they point-blank refuse to let me go ""until all of the jobs are done"" and I'm not being paid for it. So this means I have no social life whatsoever and finding time to study has become increasingly difficult as I am tired all the time from work. I'm usually asked to pick up the slack for other people that haven't finished their tasks, and managers seem to have no qualms about patronizing and bullying you into it when you try and object. Despite complaining to my Store Manager about how I'm treated, nothing is being done about this. As someone who suffers from Anxiety Disorder, this has wreaked havoc on my mental well-being, and I'm currently applying for a new job after working for the company for almost 2 years."

Pay progression is also slow with little clarity on how to move up the pay scale. This is not helped by emails often sent by the board advertising how profitable the company is continuing to be.
